# Empathia Wallet

Empathia Wallet is a fintech solution for NGO funds and Corporate Social Responsibility budget management.

Most NGOs depend 100% on private donations.

A survey shows that 50% have never donated to an NGO and the main reason is the lack of transparency. While cryptocurrency donations seem the most transparent method, only 10% of the surveyed would donate using crypto wallets.

As most people prefer local fiat payment methods, we build Empathia Wallet. Supporting local currencies and payment methods, donations are automatically converted to crypto enabling on-chain traceability.

Received funds can then be used with traditional fintech features: fiat transfers, QR transfers, prepaid cards; and also crypto transfers.

All transactions and balances, both on-chain and fiat, can be publicly audited with a friendly UI.
